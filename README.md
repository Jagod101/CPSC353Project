# CPSC353 Project - Shopify-ing the Consumer World

### Abstract
Online shopping has become an absolute nightmare for the average consumer who wishes to purchase an item that is highly sought after. Our project combats the already intense bot-marketplace. We are creating a cloud-based shopify bot that has the capability to purchase an item at a blazing fast speed. We chose shopify as the main base of this project is due to the growing community of shopify websites that are now taking over the e-commerce space. We want this bot to be universal across many different websites, not just one in particular. The user enters the url of the website, chooses specific keywords (this is how the bot finds the item), and makes a profile. This profile contains the users information that is required for purchasing an item. The bot also has connections to discord and slack, meaning anytime there is a purchase or decline on your credit card, you will receive a discord or slack notification. This is done via discord or slack webhooks. By having the bot cloud-based, it optimizes speed tremendously.

### Running Instructions
